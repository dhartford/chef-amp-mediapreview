TODO - attempt to handle installs of AMP modules onto existing Alfresco installs.

Goal - Not required to have alfresco installed via Chef.
Goal - Support repository (alfresco.war) only amps when only installing Alfresco for basic repo/CMIS access.

This is currently broken/not working around truezip dependencies and poor Chef-fu on my part around 'permission denied' on the java executable line for the classpath jars.
